Flight Data Analysis and Reporting
Objective:
Analyze airline operations data—including aircraft specifi cations, fl ight schedules, bookings, and passenger information—to gain insights into:
● Flight performance and punctuality
● Aircraft utilization and seating effi ciency
● Revenue distribution across fl ights and booking channels
● Passenger behavior and boarding patterns
Key Stakeholders:
Airline management, operations team, revenue management, customer service, and data analysts.
Schema Overview
Your schema includes the following core entities:
● AIRCRAFTS_DATA: Details about aircraft (e.g., model, range).
● AIRPORTS_DATA: Information on airports with spatial coordinates and localized names.
● FLIGHTS: Flight schedules, statuses, and references to departure/arrival airports and aircraft.
● SEATS: Seat details per aircraft including fare conditions.
● BOOKINGS & TICKETS: Reservation details and associated ticket information.
● TICKET_FLIGHTS & BOARDING_PASSES: Junction tables linking tickets with fl ights, along with fare and boarding details.
Project Steps
1. Data Import
1. Download the Airlines_schema_scripts.zip fi le from vLearn
2. Unzip the Airlines_schema_scripts.zip fi le
3. Open MySQL Workbench
4. Connect to your Database
5. Open and Execute the following SQL Scripts:
a. airlines_data_tickets.sql
b. airlines_data_aircrafts.sql
c. airlines_data_airports.sql
d. airlines_data_boarding_passes.sql
e. airlines_data_bookings.sql
f. airlines_data_fl ights.sql
g. airlines_data_seats.sql
h. airlines_data_ticket_fl ights.sql
6. After successful execution of all scripts, your schema is ready for performing analytics

2. Analysis Queries
Write SQL Select Queries for the following:
1. Calculate the Average Delay in Departures for Delayed Flight (3 Marks)
Determine, for fl ights that actually departed later than scheduled, what the average departure delay is (in minutes).
2. List Flights Grouped by Aircraft to See Usage Frequency (3 Marks)
Show how frequently each aircraft is used by counting the number of fl ights operated by each aircraft.
3. Calculate Total Revenue per Flight from the Ticket_Flights Table (3 Marks)
Aggregate the total revenue generated by each fl ight by summing up the fare amounts from the ticket_fl ights table.
4. Analyze Boarding Numbers per Flight to Detect Patterns in Boarding Pass Allocation (3 Marks)
Examine boarding pass data to identify how passengers are being boarded by calculating the average boarding number per fl ight.
5. Determine Occupancy and Fare Conditions per Aircraft (7 Marks)
Identify seat occupancy by comparing the number of boarding passes (occupied seats) to the total seats available on an aircraft, and consider the fare conditions for those seats.
6. Top 3 Flights by Revenue (3 Marks)
Identify the three fl ights that generated the highest revenue based on ticket sales.
7. Average Flight Duration by Aircraft Model (3 Marks)
Determine the average fl ight duration for each aircraft model, allowing you to see how fl ight performance might vary between different models.
8. Flight Count per Airport (Departure and Arrival) (3 Marks)
Count how many fl ights depart from and arrive at each airport to assess airport activity levels.
9. Daily Booking Trends (3 Marks)
Analyze trends in bookings over time by grouping bookings by date, counting total bookings, and summing up the revenue.
10. Frequent Routes Analysis (3 Marks)
Identify the most common routes by counting the number of fl ights for each departure–arrival airport pair.
11. Passenger Boarding Summary per Flight (3 Marks)
Determine how many passengers boarded each fl ight by counting the boarding passes issued.
12. Average Boarding Number per Flight (3 Marks)
Assess the boarding process by calculating the average boarding order number for each fl ight, which may indicate the boarding strategy or sequence.
13. Seat Occupancy Rate per Flight (7 Marks)
Measure the seat occupancy rate for each fl ight by comparing the number of boarding passes issued with the total seats available on the aircraft.
14. Total Spend per Passenger (3 Marks)
Aggregate the total amount spent by each passenger across all their tickets by joining the tickets and ticket_fl ights tables.
Note: Kindly write solution for all queries in a single SQL script fi le
